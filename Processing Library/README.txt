Processing Library setup:
1.	Download the GitHub code from this folder (“Processing Library”) and “Arduino API” (https://github.com/HCI-Lab-Saarland/ExoKit/tree/main/Arduino%20API). 
2.	Download Processing. The authors used version 4.3.
3.	Install the library.
4.	Follow the installation guide for the Arduino API.


The user manual provides further explanation on the usage of the library and an example of how to configure the exoskeleton in the Arduino API accordingly (Chapter 6).
All functions, signatures and parameters available in the library are documented in the user manual (Chapter 6).

The exokit Processing library comes with one sample sketch, which shows how to configure an exoskeleton and call functions.
Prerequisites for successfully running the example sketch:
- The physical prototype is correctly configured (right arm with active shoulder side and elbow joints).
- The exoskeleton is configured correctly in the Arduino API and the serial connection is active.
- The correct serial port is entered in the Processing code.
The user manual provides an explanation and example of how to configure the exoskeleton in the Arduino API accordingly (Chapter 6)
